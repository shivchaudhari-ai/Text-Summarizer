Machine learning is the study of computer algorithms that improve automatically through experience. 
It is seen as a subset of artificial intelligence. Machine learning algorithms build a model based on sample data, 
known as training data, to make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed to do so. 
Machine learning is used in a variety of applications, such as email filtering and computer vision, 
where it is difficult or unfeasible to develop conventional algorithms to perform the needed tasks.
